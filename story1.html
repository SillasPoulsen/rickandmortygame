        <h1>So what should we do here?</h1>
        <p> We found our way to the planet Divideion, far far away.
          Divideion turns out to be run by morons and imbeciles, who haven't had the chance to learn from our mistakes.</p>
          <p>It turns out Divideion is run by a few select aliens, according to some experts, it might be as few as 1% who control it all. This is a major threat to the idea of democracy and the values we have come to  advocate for.  </p>
