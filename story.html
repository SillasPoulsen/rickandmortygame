      <h1>How did we end up here?</h1>
      <p>
        In a not too distant future, the human species have finally conquered all obstacles ever to be known.We have  put an end to famines, droughts, climate disasters and inequality issues. </p>

 <p> We collectively agreed to take our learnings and tell the rest of the universe, and do what humans do best, colonize. </p>

<p>Our great politicians with their great ambitions, dreamt too big and used the collective brainpower to host conferences about the issues one might solve in the future.  So we asked the most generous earthlings for help, we even had to beg them to take us to outer space and save the universe. </p>
